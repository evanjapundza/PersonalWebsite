          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p class="text">Hello! My name is Evan. I am a 19 year old student at Indiana University studying Computer Science. My plans are to graduate in Spring 2024 with specializations in Cyber Security and Software Engineering. Outside of school my hobbies include aviation, rock climbing, playing guitar, and more. This past summer I decided to pursue my pilot's license with my father. I happened to be lucky enough to have him as my instructor! Unfortunately, we ran out of time before I could finish and will have to very soon.  I took up climbing as a fun way to workout and to be apart of a great community. It's been about 5 months and I can send up to 5.10d. I am hoping to break through to 5.11 soon! As for guitar, I picked it up when I decided to take an intro class to fill a GenEd credit that I needed. After taking the first class I enjoyed it so much that I took another one. Ever since then I've played at least half an hour a day. I'm not terrible anymore, but I still have plenty of room to improve!</p>
